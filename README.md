# 📊 Stock Price Visualization with 50-Day Moving Averages

This project is part of my learning journey through the **[Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/)** *Python for Finance: Investment Fundamentals and Data Analytics*. It visualizes the **closing prices** and **50-day moving averages** of three major tech stocks: **Apple (AAPL)**, **Microsoft (MSFT)**, and **Tesla (TSLA)** from **2020 to 2025**.
